# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of this community, pledge to make participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, or sexual identity.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal/political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without their explicit permission

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any violations.

- Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.
- Any member of the community can report unacceptable behavior, which should be directed to @leaderof-team

## Reporting

If you see someone violating this Code of Conduct, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly if you feel comfortable. If you're unable to resolve the matter or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, please report it.

Reports can be made to @leaderof-team
## Conclusion

We believe that discussions and disagreements can occur healthily; however, it is never acceptable to disrespect others or engage in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.
